    Hi, I’m Rishabh. I write code, break things (sometimes on purpose), fix them, and repeat—until it all just clicks.
    I love building software that feels smooth, solves real problems, and maybe even makes someone’s day a little easier. Whether it’s frontend, backend, cloud, or gluing APIs together with duct tape and hope—I’m in.
    I don’t chase trends. I chase clarity. Clean code, smart systems, and stuff that just works.
    Outside the code cave? You’ll catch me strumming my guitar, diving into underrated music, or testing my patience in the name of “fun” (thanks, Sekiro).
    Or… just staring at the ceiling pretending I’m not thinking about another side project.
    This is my little corner of the internet.
    Poke around, check out what I’ve built, and if something clicks—let’s build something together.
